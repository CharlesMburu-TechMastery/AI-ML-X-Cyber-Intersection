# 🤖🔐 AI-ML-Cyber-Intersection

**AI-ML-Cyber-Intersection** is a learning and practice repository that combines **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Cybersecurity**.

This repository documents how AI and ML concepts (such as models, data patterns, and prediction) can be applied to **cybersecurity problems** like threat detection, anomaly detection, and secure machine learning.

The goal is to build **hybrid skills** by studying AI/ML and cybersecurity **together**, not separately.

---

## 📌 Overview

Modern cybersecurity is increasingly powered by AI.

This repository focuses on:
- Core **AI and ML concepts** used in security systems
- How ML models detect threats and abnormal behavior
- How attackers try to break or fool ML systems
- How to design **secure, reliable, and ethical AI models**
- How AI improves speed, accuracy, and scale in cyber defense

The learning approach is practical, structured, and clearly documented.

## 🗂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **phases**, **quests**, and **duels**:

- **Phases** → learning stages  
- **Quests** → hands-on applications  
- **Duels** → attacker vs defender experiments
